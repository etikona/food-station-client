            WHY IS PREVENTION OF FOOD WASTE IMPORTANT
          </h3>
          <p className="text-justify  hover:text-slate-200">
            Food donation is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps to
            alleviate hunger and malnutrition in communities facing food
            insecurity, providing essential nourishment to those in need.
            Secondly, food donation reduces food waste by redirecting surplus
            edible food from being discarded to serving those who require it.
            This contributes to environmental sustainability by minimizing
            methane emissions from decomposing food in landfills. Additionally,
            food donation fosters a sense of community by encouraging
            individuals and businesses to support each other and address
            societal issues collectively. Overall, food donation is vital for
            addressing hunger, reducing waste, and building stronger, more
            resilient communities.

            1.3 metric gigatons of edible food is wasted every year and at least
            795 million people are undernourished worldwide. More than a third
            of all the food thatâ€™s produced on our planet never reaches a table.

            powerful act of compassion that can have a profound impact on
            individuals and communities. By donating surplus food, we can help
            address the pressing issue of food insecurity and ensure that
            everyone has access to the nourishment they need to thrive. Let's
            work together to make a difference by donating food and ensuring
